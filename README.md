# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
Pewlett_Harkard ("PH") currently employs 300,024 staff and has many long-time "baby boomer" employees who will be retiring at a rapid rate.  PH human resource leaders have requested analyses to prepare for the upcoming "silver tsunami".  

Employee data has only been available in Excel spreadsheets.  This project will entail creating an employee database and generating two initial analyses:

1. Determine the number of retiring employees per title
1. Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results: bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables
1. There are 90,398 employees eligible for retirement.  The table below lists the number of eligilbe retirees in each position.


2. PH utilizes a mentorship program to promote staff into vacated positions. There xxxx employees eligible for these mentorships.
