# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
Pewlett-Harkard currently employs 300,024 staff and has many long-time "baby boomer" employees who will be retiring at a rapid rate.  Pewlett-Harkard human resource leaders have requested analyses to prepare for the upcoming "silver tsunami".  

Employee data has only been available in Excel spreadsheets.  This project will entail creating an employee database and generating two initial analyses:

1. Determine the number of retiring employees per title
1. Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program

## Results:

  ### Retirees per Title (sorted by count)
  The table below lists the number of eligible retirees in each position.

* 90,398 employees (30% of Pewlett-Harkard's total workforce) are eligible for retirement.
* The greatest need will be Senior Engineer and Senior Staff positions.
    
 ### Mentor-Eligible Employees (sorted by count)
 The table below lists the number of staff eligible for the mentorship program.

* 1,549 employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
* There no eligible staff for the Manager mentorship program.
  
## Summary:
As the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact, vacancies will occur among seven roles listed above.  The side-by-side comparison below (sorted by title) highlights the fact that there are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees.  Unless Pewlett-Harkard is able to quickly implement improved processes that require fewer staff, purposeful targeted recruitment efforts will be necessary to backfill the vacated positions.
